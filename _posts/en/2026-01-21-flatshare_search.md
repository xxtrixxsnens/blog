Hi,

I’m Sven, and I’m looking for a friendly and lively shared flat (WG) in Münster—somewhere we can do things together, but where everyone can also have their own peace and quiet.

### Who am I / What do I do?

I’m 21 years old and currently in my 5th semester of a dual study program in Computer Science.

In my free time, I love being outdoors in nature, doing strength training (currently calisthenics, since I don't have a gym membership at the moment), going for runs, and working on my own "coding adventures."

On the weekends, I occasionally go out to bars or meet up with friends for a round of Mario Kart or card games.

### Interested?

Best regards, Sven
